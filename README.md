  The Event Creator works like the following. The user gets to our webpage. they are then presented with a (Log in) page. Beneath the log in page we are given a few events which are not detailed with descriptions or dates (for personal safety and privacy). Logging into the page will cause you to be redirected to the logged in screen where you will now have acess to the descriptions and date times of each event created by other users. Following this, you can see at the top right on the header-bar, the user will be presented with a (profile) button. This button will allow the user to view their own profile as well as give them the ability to create their own events. In this (create your own event) box you will be asked about the event title, the event description, and finally the event date. the right portion of the screen will be where the events created by (you) the user will be stored.
